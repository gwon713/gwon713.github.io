## Running locally

Before you start make sure you have _Ruby_ and the gems for _Jekyll_ installed locally. You can find out how to do that [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

1. Clone your resume repository locally _(if you haven't already)_
2. `cd [your-repository-name]`
3. `bundle install`
4. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4000`

Any changes you make will automatically build and you will be able to see these by refreshing your browser.

_Note: You will need to re-run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to see changes made in `_config.yml`._
